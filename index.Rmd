## Topic I --- Introduction

* Topics
    - Overview of statistical learning.
    - Getting started with R, RStudio, and RMarkdown
* Reading: Chapter 2 of ISL
* Programming basics 1: Names, classes, and objects
* Assignment 1 --- file `Topic-1.Rmd`
    * Discussion questions: ISL 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.6
    * Computing assignment: ISL 2.4.8, 2.4.9
        - As an example: a solution to 2.4.10.
    * Theory assignment: ISL 2.4.2, 2.4.7.

## Topic 2 --- Linear regression

* Readings.
    - In Chapter 3 of ISL read §3.1 & §3.2
    - Read §3.6 as you work through the commands (see computing assignment)
* Programming basics 2: 
    - Writing functions
    - Visualization: Base graphics, statistical plots
* Assignment 2 --- file `Topic-2.Rmd`
    - Computing
        - work through §3.6. (Style catastrophe: Although the book uses attach(), it is bad practice to do so. Ask about alternatives!)
        - Problem 13 in ISL 3.7.13.
    - Theory 
        - Reading questions.
            1. On p. 66 the authors state, "This is clearly not true in Fig. 3.1" Explain why.
            2. On p. 77 the authors state, "In this case we cannot even fit the multiple regression models using least squares ...." Explain why.
        - ISL 3.7.3 and 3.7.4.

## Topic 3 --- Likelihood and simulation

* Readings
    - Michael Lavine: "What is Bayesian statistics and why everything else is wrong" [PDF](Resources/Likelihood-Lavine.pdf)
* Programming basics 3: Indexing
* Visualization: Base graphics: lines, polygons, ...
* Topic assignment: 
    - Finish the exponential likelihood and taxicab in-class activities. 

## Topic 4 --- Classification

* Readings: In Chapter 4 of ISL §4.1, §4.2, §4.3.1-3, §4.4.1-2, §4.5
* Programming basics 4: Conditionals
* Visualization: Grammar of graphics: glyphs and aesthetics
* Topic 4 Assignment:
    - Programming Assignment: 4.7.11, 4.7.13
    - Theory assignment: 4.7.1, 4.7.8, 4.7.9

* Assignment: finish the in-class programming activities for the first five topics.

## Topic 6 --- Selecting model terms

* Readings: in Chapter 6 of ISL §6.1, §6.2
* Programming basics 6: Functionals --- solving, integration, optimization
* Assignment: 
    - Theory 6.8.1, 6.8.2. 
    - Applied, 6.8.9

## Topic 7 --- Nonlinear regression

* Readings: Chapter 7 of ISL

    - programming: 7.9.11
    - theory: in §7.9 problems 3, 4, and 5
 
## Topic 8 --- Tree-based methods

* Readings: Chapter 8 of ISL
* Assignment:
    - programming: 8.4.12
    - theory: In §8.4 problems 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

## Topic 9 --- Support vector machines

* Readings: Chapter 9 of ISL

## Topic 10 --- Unsupervised learning

* Readings: Chapter 10 of ISL

## End-of-term Project

* You'll form groups of two to three students and choose a problem from the Kaggle machine-learning competition site. You don't need to think about this until we get toward the end of the semester. At that point, the in-class programming activities will be given over to the project.
* If you have your own idea for a project, please get my approval before embarking on it.
