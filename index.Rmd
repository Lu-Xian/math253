## Topic I --- Introduction

* Topics
    - Overview of statistical learning.
    - Getting started with R, RStudio, and RMarkdown
* Reading: Chapter 2 of ISL
* Programming basics 1: Names, classes, and objects
* Assignment 1 --- file `Topic-1.Rmd`
    * Discussion questions: ISL 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.6
    * Computing assignment: ISL 2.4.8, 2.4.9
        - As an example: a solution to 2.4.10.
    * Theory assignment: ISL 2.4.2, 2.4.7.

## Topic 2 --- Linear regression

* Readings.
    - In Chapter 3 of ISL read ยง3.1 & ยง3.2
    - Read ยง3.6 as you work through the commands (see computing assignment)
* Programming basics 2: 
    - Writing functions
    - Visualization: Base graphics, statistical plots
* Assignment 2 --- file `Topic-2.Rmd`
    - Computing
        - work through ยง3.6. (Style catastrophe: Although the book uses attach(), it is bad practice to do so. Ask about alternatives!)
        - Problem 13 in ISL 3.7.13.
    - Theory 
        - Reading questions.
            1. On p. 66 the authors state, "This is clearly not true in Fig. 3.1" Explain why.
            2. On p. 77 the authors state, "In this case we cannot even fit the multiple regression models using least squares ...." Explain why.
        - ISL 3.7.3 and 3.7.4.
