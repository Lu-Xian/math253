# Classifiers

## Classification overview

* Response variable: categorical.  Typically just a few levels: 2 or 3.
* Two types of outputs from classification models:     
    1. The predicted category given the inputs
    2. Probability of each category given the inputs
        - Type (2) can be fitted with maximum likelihood.
* Trade-offs:     
    * Flexibility vs interpretability
    * Accuracy vs bias
* Four model architectures
    1. Logistic regression.  Especially important for interpretability.
    2. Linear discriminant analysis
    3. Quadratic discriminant analysis
    4. K nearest neighbors
